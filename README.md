Based on [this task](https://gist.github.com/zackbloom/57124a029f6bd1b8ab0e3ea5aff34d71).

## Getting Started

```


## Reading
Here are the resources I used to build this. This was my first time writing anything in Go, so I
think this section should be beginner-friendly, assuming you have some programming background!

- [HTTP Server in Go](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-an-http-server-in-go)
- [http.ServeMux documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ServeMux)
